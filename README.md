# double-pendulum
Double pendulum simulation written in JS + P5

Ever wanted to play with a double pendulum? May be extended to arbitrary pendulums @ some point.

Originally done using lagrangian mechanics, it turns out to be much simpler with Newtonian mechanics (although it 100% does not conserve energy).
